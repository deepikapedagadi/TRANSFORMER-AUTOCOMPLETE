# Real-Time Transformer Text Autocomplete

This project is a **from-scratch Transformer (Mini-GPT)** built using **PyTorch** and **Streamlit** for real-time next-token prediction.

The app takes a text input and predicts the most likely next word while visualizing **self-attention weights** to explain how the model understands context.
